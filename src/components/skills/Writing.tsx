<h3>Writing with purpose </h3>
      <p className="notes">A key component of the OET writing sub-test is the ability to identify and clearly convey your letter's purpose. </p>
      <h3>Understanding purpose </h3>
      <p className="notes">The purpose can be divided into two aspects: </p>
      <p className="notes">Immediately apparent purpose: This involves quickly identifying the main goal of your letter from the writing task and case notes. </p>

      <p className="notes">Sufficiently expanding purpose: This requires a deeper understanding of the purpose to effectively communicate it throughout the letter. </p>
      <h3>Demonstrating purpose </h3>
      <p className="notes">Once you understand the purpose, you need to clearly show it in your letter. This includes: </p>
      <p className="notes">Creating an introductory sentence: Start your letter with a sentence that clearly states the purpose. </p>
      <p className="notes">Using the right verbs: Choose verbs that accurately signal the purpose to the reader. For detailed instructions and tips, read the guide to purpose: Ultimate guide to writing: purpose </p>
      <h3>Choosing the right content </h3>
      <p className="notes">Selecting the appropriate content for your OET letter is crucial to effectively convey the necessary information. </p>
      <h3>Understanding content </h3>
      <p className="notes">Choosing the right content involves: </p>
      <p className="notes">Identifying relevant information: Determine what the reader needs to continue caring for the patient from the information provided in the case notes. </p>
      <p className="notes">Representing case notes accurately: Transform the case notes into complete sentences while maintaining their original meaning. </p>
      <h3>Implementing content </h3>
      <p className="notes">To accurately represent the case notes: </p>
      <p className="notes">Transform case notes: Convert the notes into clear, complete sentences.</p>
      <p className="notes">Maintain meaning: Ensure that the meaning of the original case notes remains unchanged. </p>
